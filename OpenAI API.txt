Here's a step-by-step guide to accessing the OpenAI Playground, choosing a model, and generating an API key for connecting to the OpenAI API:

1. Access the OpenAI Playground:
   - Go to the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).

2. Choose a Model:
   - Once you're in the Playground, you'll see a section at the top where you can choose the model you want to use. This could be models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or others available.

3. View Code:
   - After selecting the model, you'll see an option to "View code" at the top right of the interface. Click on this to view the sample code for using the model.

4. Generate OpenAI Key:
   - In the sample code section, there's a placeholder for the API key. To generate your API key:
     1. Go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) on the OpenAI website.
     2. If you donâ€™t already have an API key, you can create a new one by clicking on the "Create new secret key" button.
     3. Copy the generated API key.

5. Insert API Key into Code:
   - In the sample code you viewed in the Playground, replace the placeholder for the API key with the key you generated. It typically looks like this:
     ```python
     import openai

     openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

     response = openai.Completion.create(
       model="text-davinci-003",
       prompt="Say this is a test",
       temperature=0.5,
       max_tokens=100
     )

     print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
     ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to generate an OpenAI API key and use it in your code to interact with the OpenAI API. Make sure to keep your API key secure and not share it publicly.
